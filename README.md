# Knowledge-and-representation-Project
The project involves building an ontology for the animal kingdom. The main objective of the project is to create a structure that can represent the relationships between different animals, their habitats, their physical and  behavioral characteristics, and their ecological interactions.
The ontology was developed using OWL (Web Ontology Language) and Proteg√©.
Moreover, I implemented a series of SPARQL and DL queries to enable the extraction of specific data, improving the analytical capability of this ontology.
